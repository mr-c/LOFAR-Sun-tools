# Interferometry Imaging

## Download or Stage data (.MS file)

The LOFAR data is stored at [LTA](https://lta.lofar.eu/Lofar)

Request the data then download the data with **wget**

## Preprocess

If the data is un-calibrated data, do use the NDPPP to auto weight the data set:

```bash
NDPPP msin=path/to/rawdata.MS msout=path/to/output.MS steps=[] msin.autoweight=true
```

The script autoWeight.sh can batch this process if there is more than one file

(This step can be skipped if the measurement set has been calibrated.)

## Calibration

The calibration depends on NDPPP module developed by LOFAR, so run this line before everything:

```bash
 module load lofar
 module load dp3
```

The meassurement set is calibrated with NDPPP in three steps:

- **Predicted Calculation** : use the calibrator to predict the gain calculation
- **Apply Calculation** : apply the gain calculation to the sun
- **Apply Beam** : apply the LOFAR beam to the dataset

These steps can be done with a script [auto_sun_calib.py](../pro/script/auto_sun_calib.py), the script automized the calibration of interferometry, it generates the parset file for the calibration and run the corresponding NDPPP commad.

Modify the configuration lines in the code:

```python
sources  = 'TauAGG'  # source type
sourcedb = 'taurus_1.sourcedb' # path to the source

sun_MS_dir   = 'MS/' # path to the dir contain sun's MS 
calib_MS_dir = 'MS/' # path to the dir contain calibrator's MS

obs_id_sun   = 'L722384' # obsid of the sun
obs_id_calib = 'L701915' # obsid of the calibrator

idx_range_sun  = [32,39] # index range of the subband of the Sun
idx_range_cali = [92,99] # index range of the subband of the Sun

run_step = [0,1,2]; # 0 for predict; 1 for applycal;  2 for applybeam
# [0,1,2] for complete calibration
```

Run the calibration script simply  with:

```bash
python auto_sun_calib.py
```

## Clean

An example of wsclean for the sun [wsclean_script.sh](../pro/script/wsclean_script.sh), it is better to keep the parameter **-multiscale** on for the solar image CLEAN, because the solar radio emission is always extended.

A small cheatsheet for solar wsclean:

| Command        | Parameter      | Comment                                                                                      |
|----------------|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| -j             | 20             | Number of thread used for CLEAN.  (can be equal to the number of cores)                      |
| -mem           | 80             | Maximum memory limit in percent to  the system memory. (Don't use 100%)                      |
| -weight        | briggs 0.2     | Weight for the baselines. (Briggs 0  works for most of the situations)                       |
| -size          | 2048 2048      | Size of the image in pixel.                                                                  |
| -scale         | 3asec          | The scale of one pixel, can be  0.1asec,3asec, 3min, 3deg                                    |
| -pol           | I              | The polarization for cleaning,  can be I,Q,U,V.                                              |
| -multiscale    | \              | Whether to use multiscale in the  clean. Better to switch on for  extended source            |
| -data-column   | CORRECTED\_DATA | Be sure to use the calibrated data  (CORRECTED\_DATA)                                       |
| -niter         | 2000           | The iteration of clean, for the sun,  400 is necessary, 1000 can be better,  2000 is enough. |
| -intervals-out | 85             | How many images you want to produce                                                          |
| -interval      | 3000 4000      | The index range for the CLEAN                                                                |

for the interval index, one can use the get\_datetime\_index.py to find out the starting and ending index

## Visualization

WSClean produces fits image with astronomy coordinate \[RA,DEC\] and the unit of Jy/Beam, the module *LofarDataCleaned* in [lofarData](../pro/src/lofarSun/lofarData.py) can transform the coordinate to heliocentric frame and convert the flux to brightness temperature distribution according to the equation given in the Equation given in [Flux intensity](https://science.nrao.edu/facilities/vla/proposing/TBconv).

For the use of jupyterlab in CEP3

```bash
ssh -L 1234:localhost:1234 username@portal.lofar.eu -t ssh -L 1234:localhost:1234 username@lhd001 -t ssh -L 1234:localhost:1234 username@lof001

source /data/scratch/zhang/conda_start.sh

python -m jupyter notebook --no-browser --port=1234
```

Change username and 1234 accordingly.
