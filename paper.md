# Summary

Low frequency radio observations of the Sun are a powerful tool for studying, monitoring and forecasting solar activity. The LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR) is a new generation of radio interferometer that is capable of observing the Sun at frequencies below 240 MHz. The LOFAR Solar and Space Weather Key Science Project (KSP) is a community-based project that aims to develop and implement the data processing tools for the solar radio imaging spectroscopy data processing of LOFAR. 
We developed a set of Python tools, called `lofarSun`, dedicated for the solar radio imaging spectroscopy data processing of LOFAR. The lofarSun tools are designed to be modular and flexible, and can be easily adapted to other solar radio observations.

# Statement of need

`lofarSun` is a set of Python tools for the solar radio imaging spectroscopy data processing of LOFAR [@vanHaarlem:2013].
